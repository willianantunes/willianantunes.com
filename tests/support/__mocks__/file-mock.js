// You can mock anything, and here you are mocking assets rather than code.
// For stylesheets you need to use the package identity-obj-proxy. For all other assets, you need to use a manual

// The convention is to create a directory called __mocks__ in the root directory for this.
// Note the pair of double underscores in the name.
