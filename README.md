At the beginning of 2021, I created a project called [Rave of Phonetics](https://www.raveofphonetics.com/), and you can know how I had the idea through the blog post [public and useful tool to understand phonetics](https://www.raveofphonetics.com/blog/2021/02/public-and-useful-tool-to-understand-phonetics/). With all the lessons learned I gathered from it, I thought it was time to create my very blog from scratch to discover even more things. That's how it came to life! Curiosity as always ðŸ‘€

I think this couldn't have been possible without the following projects:

- [felipefialho/felipefialho.com](https://github.com/felipefialho/felipefialho.com)
- [dustinmoris/dustedcodes](https://github.com/dustinmoris/dustedcodes)

Hence here's my thanks! I am thankful for people that share stuff with the community ðŸ¤“

## Running the project

Just issue the command `docker-compose up`. It will build the image and run it for you afterwards. If you have an [OAuth Provider configured on Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/oauth-provider-tokens/), you can even access the admin page. Accessible links:

- Home: http://localhost:9000/
- RSS: http://localhost:9000/rss.xml
- Sitemap: http://localhost:9000/sitemap.xml
- CMS: http://localhost:9000/genie

If you'd like to run it without docker, first install the packages:

    npm install

Then you can just issue `npm run develop`, but let's say that you want to build it, for that execute the following:

    GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER_ID=YOUR_GTM_ID \
    SITE_URL=http://localhost:9000/ \
    NETLIFY_CMS_BACKEND_REPO=YOUR_REPO \
    NETLIFY_CMS_BACKEND_BRANCH=YOUR_BRANCH \
    npm run build

Now you can serve it through gatsby (not recommended for production, just as a means to evaluate what was built):

    GOOGLE_TAG_MANAGER_ID=YOUR_GTM_ID \
    SITE_URL=http://localhost:9000/ \
    NETLIFY_CMS_BACKEND_REPO=YOUR_REPO \
    NETLIFY_CMS_BACKEND_BRANCH=YOUR_BRANCH \
    npm run serve

Sadly, even when serving the generated static files, gatsby reads `gatsby-config.js`, that's why you need to set the environment variables.

### Netlify CMS locally

You need to run `npm run cms` and `npm run develop`, then you can use the CMS locally without the need of doing OAuth flow.

## I want to use your project. How do I use this template?

That is quite simple. Just follow the bullets:

- You need to change `siteMetadata` const with you own data (see the file [gatsby-config.js](./gatsby-config.js)).
- To run locally properly, update [.env.development](./.env.development) as well.
- Delete the content of [content/blog](./content/blog) folder and create your own very post.

That's it!
