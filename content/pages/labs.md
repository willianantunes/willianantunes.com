    title: DRF Like Paginations
    projectLink: https://github.com/willianantunes/drf-like-paginations
    description: It's a C# library that mimics LimitOffsetPagination class available
      on DRF (Django Rest Framework). If you are tired of creating pagination
      all the time in your .NET projects, this can come in handy for you.

    title: Django Multiple Schemas
    projectLink: https://github.com/willianantunes/django-multiple-schemas
    description: Here you'll find a simple project that shows how to use schema with
      Django and why you should use. It has a script that creates all the
      scenarios the project needs in PostgreSQL. It even has tests to guarantee
      that it's created as expected.

    title: Transcriber Wrapper
    description: It's a wrapper of back-ends that convert text to phones for
      multiple languages using the International Phonetic Alphabet. It provides
      an interface where you can interact with the supported back-ends using
      Python.

    projectLink: https://github.com/willianantunes/willianantunes.com
    description: It was built from the ground up using Gatsby. It uses Netlify CMS,
      Jest, React Testing Library, SonarCloud, styled-components, and many more!

    title: A place where you can learn Phonetics
    projectLink: https://www.raveofphonetics.com/
    description: I realized that there were many phonetic transcription sites, but
      they did not have even the most basic features. That's how it was
      conceived! The front-end uses Gatsby and the back-end Django.

    description: It can be identified as the Word Suggestion API on the image. The
      idea here is to delay 1 second or more (given your custom configuration)
      to answer a request. Thus you can use this behavior for interesting tests,
      like dispatching ten requests from your back-end to this service and do it
      efficiently with some approaches like through Threads or Coroutines.

    title: Tic Tac Toe C# Playground
    description: It's a fully implemented Tic Tac Toe API game made with .NET Core
      3.1 Web API. I hadn't been touching C# language for over four years until
      I decided to create this playground. The project has unit and integration
      tests with PostgreSQL. As it uses Docker, you can easily make the service
      up and play a game!

    projectLink: https://github.com/juntossomosmais/python-fluentd-testing
    description: Tired of testing fluentd and wasting lots of your precious time
      with manual tests? How about the lag it causes to your machine? Now you
      can easily test your configuration with this project using containers!

    title: DRF Link Navigation Pagination
    projectLink: https://github.com/juntossomosmais/drf-link-navigation-pagination
    description: Django Rest Framework has a built-in pagination feature, and that's
      awesome. Now suppose you have a reverse proxy intermediating the request
      process. In that case, you may need to change some of the pagination
      attributes to point to your API address correctly. You can use this
      third-party package to help you out on this issue.

    title: Next.JS Playground through a code challenge
    projectLink: https://github.com/willianantunes/nextjs-playground
    description: You'll see my solution for a code challenge which I think is not
      used anymore as it's old; maybe if you search for this code challenge, you
      may find it somewhere on GitHub. As I made it to do a playground on some
      technologies, I  even used Redux to test it. Thus it's important to say
      that I don't recommend it for simple cases.
