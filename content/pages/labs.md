    title: Django Multiple Schemas
    projectLink: https://github.com/willianantunes/django-multiple-schemas
    description: Here you'll find a simple project that shows how to use schema with
      Django and why you should use. It has a script that creates all the
      scenarios the project needs in PostgreSQL. It even has tests to guarantee
      that it's created as expected.

    title: Transcriber Wrapper
    description: It's a wrapper of back-ends that convert text to phones for
      multiple languages using the International Phonetic Alphabet. It provides
      an interface where you can interact with the supported back-ends using
      Python.

    title: A place where you can learn Phonetics
    projectLink: https://www.raveofphonetics.com/
    description: I realized that there were many phonetic transcription sites, but
      they did not have even the most basic features. That's how it was
      conceived! The front-end uses Gatsby and the back-end Django.

    description: It can be identified as the Word Suggestion API on the image. The
      idea here is to delay 1 second or more (given your custom configuration)
      to answer a request. Thus you can use this behavior for interesting tests,
      like dispatching ten requests from your back-end to this service and do it
      efficiently with some approaches like through Threads or Coroutines.

    title: Tic Tac Toe C# Playground
    description: It's a fully implemented Tic Tac Toe API game made with .NET Core
      3.1 Web API. I hadn't been touching C# language for over four years until
      I decided to create this playground. The project has unit and integration
      tests with PostgreSQL. As it uses Docker, you can easily make the service
      up and play a game!
