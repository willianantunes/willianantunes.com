**Warning:** This is a note, so don't expect much üòÖ!

How can you assert if a CORS configuration is configured correctly ü§î? Basically, you have the following options:

* You configure it according to the required context and then tell whoever asked you the task that it's done. The person tests it for you then ü§•.
* The same as above, but we test everything before informing anyone else.

I usually do the second. The first option tends to fail to work, especially at special moments (Murphy's law). Though time is important, if we spend some time testing the configuration by ourselves, we save time in the end. It works like unit tests. The straightforward approach is to use [CURL](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68497292/3899136). You just need to know how [prelight request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) works. In this note, I'll explain a more complicated method that shows more possibilities. So, let's suppose we have the following CORS configuration:

![The panel is from Akamai. It shows a behavior called CORS Protocol Support. It allows the method GET from 2 origins, google.com and chat.openai.com.](/assets/posts/blog-36-asset-1-sample-cors-configuration.png "CORS Protocol Support")

To test it locally, we can create the following Python script called `server.py`:

```python
import http.server
import socketserver
import ssl

from pathlib import Path

context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)

print("Configuring context with a certificate")
context.load_cert_chain(Path("cert.pem"))

address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 443
print(f"Server address: {address}:{port}")
server_address = (address, port)
handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

with socketserver.TCPServer(server_address, handler) as httpd:
    httpd.socket = context.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, server_side=True)
    print(f"Serving content from the current folder: {Path('.').absolute()}")
    httpd.serve_forever()
```

To serve through HTTPS, we need a certificate. Let's create one by using `openssl`:

```shell
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout cert.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

For example, we can execute a GET in any resource to provoke the CORS configuration. So, let's create the following `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Sample test</h1>
<p id="output"></p>
<script>
    const address = ""https://DOMAIN-THAT-HAS-CORS-CONFIGURATION/agrabah/jafar/lamp.json"

    async function doIt() {
        try {
            const headers = {Pragma: "akamai-x-get-client-ip, akamai-x-cache-on, akamai-x-cache-remote-on, akamai-x-check-cacheable, akamai-x-get-cache-key, akamai-x-get-nonces, akamai-x-get-ssl-client-session-id, akamai-x-get-true-cache-key, akamai-x-serial-no, akamai-x-feo-trace, akamai-x-get-request-id, akamai-x-im-trace"}
            const result = await fetch(address, {headers})
            const body = await result.json()
            console.log(body)
            document.querySelector("#output").innerHTML = `The status code is ${result.status}`
        } catch (e) {
            document.querySelector("#output").innerHTML = `It failed! <strong>${e}</strong>`
        }
    }

    doIt()
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

You can add any [Pragma headers](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edge-diagnostics/docs/pragma-headers) you need to check other things beyond CORS, like cache configuration. Regarding Akamai, you may need to activate debug behavior in your property. Then, we can run the command:

```
sudo python3 server.py
```

We have to use `sudo` to elevate the process to root because of port 443. Now, we are almost there! You should change `/etc/hosts` by adding the following lines:

```
127.0.0.1       google.com
127.0.0.1       chat.openai.com
```

If we access `https://chat.openai.com/` or `https://google.com/` the browser will say `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID`. We can bypass it by proceeding.

![When you try to access a not secure website, the browser offers a link where you accept to proceed though it's unsafe. The image shows this link where you can continue.](/assets/posts/blog-36-asset-2-proceed-unsafe-access.png "Proceeding unsafe with address.")

That's it! You are good to go üëç!

I hope this may help you. See you üòÑ!
