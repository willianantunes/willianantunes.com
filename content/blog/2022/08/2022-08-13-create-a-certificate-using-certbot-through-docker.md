One of the projects I had to deal with recently was close to the following architecture:

![The technical architecture shows three actors: a person, the CDN (content delivery network), and a bucket S3. It shows the process of retrieving an asset through HTTP GET.](/assets/posts/blog-29-order-1-image-1-architecture.png "Architecture")

The red part is where you make an HTTP request. You usually do it with an HTTPS endpoint through a custom domain. So, instead of using the CloudFront address, let's say `d7w4qdbq7iqgl.cloudfront.net`, you use a custom one like `assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com`.

As I was using my own account to test the whole architecture, I tried to avoid costs as much as possible. One of the things I could do was import the certificate for the custom domain. According to [ACM pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/pricing/), you pay 0.75 USD per certificate, which means something close to 4 BRL (my country's currency), and you only pay for it if the certificate is issued by AWS. Thus, let's issue our own certificate using [Cerbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and import it to ACM. 

## Certbot as Compose service

Reading the [Certbot User Guide](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html), we'll see the following directories are essential:

* [`/etc/letsencrypt`](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#where-are-my-certificates): All generated keys and issued certificates can be found in this folder.
* [`/var/lib/letsencrypt`](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#id5): Where some of the lock files are stored.
* [`/var/log/letsencrypt`](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#log-rotation): Status logs can be found in this folder.

Let's use them as volume to create the compose service:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    volumes:
      - ./etc-letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./var-lib-letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt
      - ./var-log-letsencrypt:/var/log/letsencrypt
```

Now, if we execute the command:

```shell
docker-compose run certbot --help
```

That's the output:

```text
Creating network "certbot-terraform-s3-cloudfront_default" with the default driver
Creating certbot-terraform-s3-cloudfront_certbot_run ... done

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  certbot [SUBCOMMAND] [options] [-d DOMAIN] [-d DOMAIN] ...

Certbot can obtain and install HTTPS/TLS/SSL certificates.  By default,
it will attempt to use a webserver both for obtaining and installing the
certificate. The most common SUBCOMMANDS and flags are:

obtain, install, and renew certificates:
    (default) run   Obtain & install a certificate in your current webserver
    certonly        Obtain or renew a certificate, but do not install it
    renew           Renew all previously obtained certificates that are near
expiry
    enhance         Add security enhancements to your existing configuration
   -d DOMAINS       Comma-separated list of domains to obtain a certificate for

  (the certbot apache plugin is not installed)
  --standalone      Run a standalone webserver for authentication
  (the certbot nginx plugin is not installed)
  --webroot         Place files in a server's webroot folder for authentication
  --manual          Obtain certificates interactively, or using shell script
hooks

   -n               Run non-interactively
  --test-cert       Obtain a test certificate from a staging server
  --dry-run         Test "renew" or "certonly" without saving any certificates
to disk

manage certificates:
    certificates    Display information about certificates you have from Certbot
    revoke          Revoke a certificate (supply --cert-name or --cert-path)
    delete          Delete a certificate (supply --cert-name)

manage your account:
    register        Create an ACME account
    unregister      Deactivate an ACME account
    update_account  Update an ACME account
    show_account    Display account details
  --agree-tos       Agree to the ACME server's Subscriber Agreement
   -m EMAIL         Email address for important account notifications

More detailed help:

  -h, --help [TOPIC]    print this message, or detailed help on a topic;
                        the available TOPICS are:

   all, automation, commands, paths, security, testing, or any of the
   subcommands or plugins (certonly, renew, install, register, nginx,
   apache, standalone, webroot, etc.)
  -h all                print a detailed help page including all topics
  --version             print the version number

```

## Creating the certificate through domain validation

We'll use the [manual approach](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#manual) to get the certificate with the DNS challenge. The command below has the `--dry-run` flag. Remove it when you feel the result is fine:

```shell
docker-compose run certbot certonly -d assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com \
--manual --preferred-challenges dns --dry-run
```

You'll see something like the following:

```text
Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com.

with the following value:

HIRw2QxqFowxWUQS9_te5Irxog10Nom-yjuj1uVn_oM

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.
```

That's the part where we have to create a TXT DNS record. When this step is complete and validated, that's what we'll see:

```text
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2022-10-01.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.

We are ready to import the signed certificate into AWS Certificate Manager ðŸ˜›!

## Importing Certbot certificate into ACM using Terraform

Having the file `main.tf` in the folder where is the compose file, that's the resource we can configure:

```ruby
resource "aws_acm_certificate" "cert_assets_amazonplayground" {
  private_key       = file("${path.module}/etc-letsencrypt/live/assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com/privkey.pem")
  certificate_body  = file("${path.module}/etc-letsencrypt/live/assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com/cert.pem")
  certificate_chain = file("${path.module}/etc-letsencrypt/live/assets.amazonplayground.willianantunes.com/fullchain.pem")
}
```

This is enough to import the certificate into ACM. Then, as an example, we can apply it on CloudFront, referencing the ACM resource:

```ruby
resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "cdn" {
  # A bunch of code...

  viewer_certificate {
    acm_certificate_arn            = aws_acm_certificate.cert_assets_amazonplayground.arn
    cloudfront_default_certificate = true
    minimum_protocol_version       = "TLSv1"
    ssl_support_method             = "sni-only"
  }
}
```

[Look at the whole code](https://github.com/willianantunes/tutorials/blob/5c03611e5fe077996327b4273dcae4e1d4692173/2022/08/certbot-terraform-s3-cloudfront/main.tf).

## Conclusion

Certbot is a very intuitive and easy program to use. As I say to my coworkers, we don't need to install most of the tools to do our jobs in our machines. With containers, we can simply fire up a container and do the job from there. This is not always true, though. I recommend reading the [Certbot documentation](https://eff-certbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#running-with-docker) where this issue is briefly discussed.
